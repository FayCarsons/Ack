# Ack!
*"Used to express mild alarm or dismay"* - Merriam-Webster dictionary

*Ack!* is an OCaml library for acceleration structures, data structures designed to optimize spatial queries. <br>
Use cases include raytracing, game dev, data science, or rolling your own spatial database. <br>
This is the library you use when the performance of your spatial queries makes you say *"Ack!"*

Currently, *Ack!* is a work-in-progress, and contains only Quadtrees, Octrees, and an unfinished KD-tree.
I have plans to add other data structures including DDAs, BKD-trees, BVHs, spatial hashes, and potentially more!

API documentation, instructions fo running, testing, contributing to come soon!

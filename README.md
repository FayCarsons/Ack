# Ack!
*"Used to express mild alarm or dismay"* - Merriam-Webster dictionary

*Ack!* is an Ocaml library for acceleration structures, data strucures designed to optimize spatial queries. <br> 
Use cases include raytracing, game dev, data science, or building your own spatial database. <br>
This is the library you use when the performance of your spatial queries makes you say *"Ack!"*.

Currently, *Ack!* is a work-in-progress, and contains only Quadtrees and Octrees. 
I have plans to add other data structures including KD-trees, DDAs, BKD-trees, BVHs, spatial hashes, and potentially more!

API documentation, instructions fo running, testing, contributing to come soon!
